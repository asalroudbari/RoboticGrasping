Vision-based Robotic Grasping of Household Objects: A practical case study


## Abstract
Robotic grasping technology is gaining widespread use due to its ability to assist with household tasks, such as table setting or packing ordered food for delivery. However, accurately detecting and grasping household objects can be challenging. In this study, we propose a system that employs YOLOv8 for object segmentation and engages computer-vision techniques to determine the grasping rectangle for each object.
